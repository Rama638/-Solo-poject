<p id="content1">Meditate every morning and every evening for 15-30 minutes. It is best to meditate before you eat. When you have finished meditating lay down and rest for 4-5 minutes. Itâ€™s fine if you fall asleep during meditation, but when you wake up meditate for a couple more minutes and then lay down and rest for a couple more minutes. If you have trouble getting to sleep at night, try meditating before laying down to sleep.</p>
